## An implementation (WIP) of the Paper "High Performance By Example Noise"

#### Notes:
* A quick sketch of the paper is: input (low-res texture) -gaussianize-> gaussian_image -blending-> blended gaussian -inverse_gaussianize-> high-res texture. So ideally you can get an infinite resolution texture with similar histogram as the input.
  
* The implementation is currently an offline solution. I use PyOT to gaussianize the input texture, OpenGL (GLSL) to perform the blend and PyOT to perform the inverse transform.

* The LUT real-time solution is currently under investigation (bugged for now)

* The dependencies of python environment is under `./requirements.txt`

  * To use (Python version 3.9.6)

  * ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

* The dependencies of OpenGL environments are listed in `CMakeLists.txt`

* Choose from different blending method. (LUT method unavailable)

  * Press space to hide GUI
  * Press tab to take a screenshot (as the input for inverse transform), the screenshot will be saved to your input path

* Use screenshot from OpenGL blending (click Use Gaussian to get the blended gaussian image), feed to the `inverse_gaussianize.py` file to get the final result.

#### Bugs / Artifacts of Implementation 

* Most of the values after Gaussian->Uniform transform are within the range [0.467, 0.533], if we use a lut on the range of [0,1], we might get most of our pixels mapped to the same color. And thus making the results having very low contrast.

* The blending might gets horizontal or vertical artifacts for some reason (i.e. not seamless).

* The Optimal Transport method in my implementation makes the final histogram look squiggly (see results below).
